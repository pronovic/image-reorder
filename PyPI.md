Reorder images from multiple cameras into a single folder

To use, create a source directory (say, `pictures`) with a subdirectory for
each camera (`pictures/mom`, `pictures/dad`, etc.).  Run the `analyze` command
to get some basic info about what images exist in the source directory:

```
$ reorder analyze --help
Usage: reorder analyze [OPTIONS] <source-dir>

  Analyze images in a source directory.

  Finds all images in a source directory and generates some information about
  those images, including camera models.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Then, run the `copy` command to copy files from the source directory to some
target directory:

```
$ reorder copy --help
Usage: reorder copy [OPTIONS] <source-dir> <target-dir>

  Reorder images from a source directory into a target directory.

  Finds all images in a source directory and reorders them into a target
  directory by EXIF creation date, taking into account any offsets.  The
  target folder will be created if it does not already exist.

  The copied filenames will get a prefix like "image001__".  This way, you can
  sort the images by filename, and they'll have the correct order.

  If the clocks on the cameras are not in sync, you may optionally provide a
  time offset by camera model.  The configured hours and minutes will be added
  to or removed from the the actual EXIF time.  Use a format like "PowerShot
  A70=+06:55" or "Pixel 2=-00:03".  The `reorder analyze` command will show
  you all of the different camera models among your images.  You can provide
  the --offset switch multiple times.

Options:
  -o, --offset <offset>  Time offset like 'PowerShot A70=+06:55'
  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.
```
